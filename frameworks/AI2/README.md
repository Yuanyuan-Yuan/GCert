# AI2/ERAN

The official implementation is provided [here](https://github.com/eth-sri/eran). In our experiments, we use the adaptor provided by [VeriGauge](https://github.com/AI-secure/VeriGauge) to set up AI2/ERAN.

[VeriGauge](https://github.com/AI-secure/VeriGauge) and [AI2/ERAN](https://github.com/eth-sri/eran) are well implemented and documented; you can smoothly set up everything following their instructions.
