# Frameworks

GCert is incorporated into the following three frameworks for certification.

- ERAN (a.k.a. AI$^2$): AI2: Safety and Robustness Certification of Neural Networks with Abstract Interpretation (IEEE S&P 2018). See [here]() for setups.

- ExactLine: Computing Linear Restrictions of Neural Networks (NeurIPS 2019). See [here]() for setups.

- GenProver: Robustness Certification with Generative Models (PLDI 2021). See [here]() for setups.
